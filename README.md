# AI Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository showcasing my journey in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) since 2020. This repository serves as a testament to my commitment to learning and practical application in the exciting world of AI.

## Repository Structure

### Data_Analysis_Libraries
In this folder, you will find Jupyter notebooks containing my early forays into AI. These notebooks primarily focus on data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. They serve as a foundational stepping stone in my AI journey.

### End-to-End-Projects
The End-to-End Projects folder contains a collection of comprehensive AI projects. These projects encompass a wide range of AI concepts and are meticulously detailed. Each project represents a significant milestone in my journey, where I applied my learnings to real-world problems.

### Text Cleaning and Transformers
During my first job in Germany, I delved into text cleaning using R and explored the fascinating world of transformer models. The skills and knowledge gained during this phase opened up new avenues for me in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### OPENAI 
In 2023, I ventured into the realm of large language models, captivated by the growing excitement surrounding them. I embarked on experiments involving OpenAI's models, harnessing their capabilities for various AI tasks. This exploration was influenced by my professional work, further enhancing my expertise in AI.There is a lot more that I have done in this realm. However, due to professional confidentiality I can not show case them here.

### Reinforcement Learning
My academic journey has included extensive work in Checkers. This folder contains the fruits of my labor in the RL field, reflecting my dedication to mastering this essential AI subdomain.

### Others
The Others folder houses additional files and projects that I've undertaken during my AI journey. These may include supplementary learnings, experiments, or projects that don't neatly fit into the other categories but are nonetheless significant in my development.
